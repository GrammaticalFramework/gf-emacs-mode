| =C-c C-s=   | run GF shell                                        |

* features

- syntax highlighting
- indentation support
- integrated GF shell
- display =oper= type declaration in minibuffer

* to-do
if you'd like to have a feature implemented, you should file at ticket
at the [[https://github.com/odanoburu/conllu-mode/issues][issue tracker]]. here is our current to-do list:

- adding gf-mode to MELPA
  - adhere to code standards
    - use cl-lib
    - naming prefix
    - docstrings
- automatic indentation, like =gofmt=
- flycheck : needs better error messages from GF compiler
- ...
  
* installation
** MELPA
   soon.
** manual installation
   clone the repo and put these files where emacs will load them, as
   in:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ cd ~/some/path/
     $ git clone https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-emacs-mode
   #+END_SRC
   in your =.emacs=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/path/gf-emacs-mode"
     (autoload 'run-gf "gf" nil t)
     (autoload 'gf-mode "gf" nil t)
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.gf\\(\\|e\\|r\\|cm?\\)\\'" . gf-mode))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cf\\'" . gf-mode))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ebnf\\'" . gf-mode))
   #+END_SRC
